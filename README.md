# Greatest-common-divisor-GCD-of-two-numbers-using-FSM-with-datapath-using-verilog.

The system uses Verilog HDL to describe the behavior of the FSM and the datapath, and it is simulated and tested using ModelSim. The design process involves defining the states and transitions of the FSM, and mapping the required operations to the datapath elements such as registers, adders, and comparators. The GCD algorithm is implemented using the Euclidean algorithm, which iteratively subtracts the smaller number from the larger one until they become equal. The system is capable of handling 16-bit numbers and produces the correct GCD output within a few clock cycles.
